### About Me

My name is Alex Demerjian and I am 18 years old. I am from Montville, NJ and I attended Montville Township High School. I have one older sister, one younger half-brother, and one step-brother. I have two dogs, one who is a shihtzu and another that is a lab/german shepherd mix. My favorite color is blue and I enjoy basketball, tennis, video games, and technology. My goal is to eventually work at Apple.
